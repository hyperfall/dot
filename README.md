## Dotfile 2022 - FUI
This theme is inspired mainly by futuristic UI, I wanted to reproduce them in a window manager. This theme achives this by using specific colors, my plan was to create a everything in awesome window manager but since my skills are lacking and don't have enough time to dedicate to this I gave up on that and decided this route. Hyprland provides a good enviorment for me to work with.
